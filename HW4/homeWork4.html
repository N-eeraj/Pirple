   <ol>
    <li> 
	 In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and parmesan cheese. Season the chicken with salt and pepper;
	dredge in the flour mixture; shake off excess and set aside.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	Heat 1 tablespoon of oil and 2 teaspoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until butter has melted and pan is hot.
	 Fry the chicken until golden on each side and cooked through and no longer pink
	(about 3-4 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer onto a warm plate.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	Add the garlic to the oil in the pan (spray with a light coating of oil if needed) and fry until fragrant (about 1 minute).
	Reduce heat to low-medium heat, add the broth and cream.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer; season with salt and pepper to your taste; add in the parmesan cheese and capers. 
	Continue cooking gently for about 2 minutes until thicker. (If the sauce is too runny for your liking,
	 add the cornstarch/water mixture into the centre of the pan and mix through fast to combine into the sauce.
	 It will begin to thicken immediately).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	Pour in the lemon juice, allow to simmer for a further minute to combine. Add the chicken back into the pan, 
	allow to simmer gently in the sauce for about a minute to soak up all of the flavours in the sauce.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
	Serve with the sauce over pasta, steamed vegetables, zucchini noodles or rice. Top with extra capers to garnish, lemon slices and parsley.
    </li>
   </ol>
