So far I have learnt introduction to HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark-Up Language
Doctype (<!DOCTYPE html>) is an "signal to the browser to expect a HTML type  document
<HTML><Head><body> tags and their closing </HTML></Head></body>tags
	<HTML></HTML> Contains all the other tags. It can be considered as a "Master Tag"
	<Head></Head> Contains some tags of the webpage such as Title & Meta tags
		<Title></Title> Used to give the webpage a name
		<meta charset='utf-8'> Is used support other languages & symbols
	<Body></Body> Contains all the contents of the webpage
		<p></p> used to type in paragraphs in a webpage

Container Tags : Has opening & Closing tag
Empty Tags     : Has only Opening tag

There  are 2 types of list in HTML
	Un-Ordered List : Bullets(Different types are {circle,disc,square})
	Ordered List	: Numbered(Different types are {1,i,I,a,A})
Lists can be nested, ie a list can exist within another one
