	Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
	and Wizardry, along with the school's groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, deliver a recently orphaned infant named Harry 
	Potter to his only remaining relatives, the Dursleys. Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointing life with 
	the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving 
	unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and 
	informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After 
	taking Harry to Diagon Alley to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid 
	informs him of his past: Harry's parents James and Lily Potter died due to a Killing Curse at the hands of the 
	malevolent and all-powerful wizard: Lord Voldemort. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the 
	wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived".
