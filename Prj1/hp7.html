	Following Albus Dumbledore's death, Voldemort consolidates support and power, including attempting to take control of 
	the Ministry of Magic. Meanwhile, Harry is about to turn seventeen, at which time he will lose the protection of his 
	home. Members of the Order of the Phoenix explain the situation to the Dursleys and move them to a new location for 
	protection. Using several of Harry's peers and friends as decoys, the Order plans to move Harry to the Burrow under 
	protection, by flying him there. However, the Death Eaters have been tipped off about this plan, and the group is attacked 
	upon departure. In the ensuing battle, "Mad-Eye" Moody and Hedwig are killed and George Weasley severely wounded. 
	Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Harry's wand fends him off on its own.
