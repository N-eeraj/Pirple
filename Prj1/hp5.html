	During another summer with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter is expelled from Hogwarts after he uses magic 
	to save himself and Dudley Dursley from Dementors. Harry is whisked off by a group of wizards including Mad-Eye Moody, 
	Remus Lupin and several new faces including Nymphadora Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the 
	home of his godfather Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret 
	organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore which informs Harry that the Ministry of Magic is refusing to believe Lord 
	Voldemort's return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have 
	during his previous attack.
