This project gives a brief introduction to the Wizarding world of Harry Potter.
The project consists of 8 HTML files & 2 CSS files.
All the pages has the basic tags such as <html>,<head>,<body>,<title>,<meta>,etc.
CSS files are linked to HTML using a <link> tag.

The main page is home.html & it's CSS file is home.css
There is an audio file in this web page, it was implemented using the <audio> tag. The main heading is given using a <header> 
tag and lies between 2 <hr>.Then we get a brief introduction to the books including the author's name which is a in page link using <a>. 
The paragraph is moved to left using padding-left & colored using background in the CSS.Then we have the plot of the story, 
the heading uses <h1> tag & the paragraph that follows is colored the same as above one.
After this there are a few images of the covers of the 7 books of Harry Potter (<img>), these images acts as links to 
go to the page of the respective boook using <a> tag. The image styling is mentioned in the CSS file, styling 
includes width, opacity(0.8), padding & transition.The CSS file also adds a hover effect for each of the images, 
the image/link changes it's size(110%) & opacity(full).
After a line theres is an image of Hogwarts(The central location of the story) and to it's right there is a section about the 
author(J.K. Rowling), including a heading in <h1>, image using <img>, <p> contains the info. & a link(<a> tag) with its href value
being the web address of J.K Rowling's Official website.
There is an image which is fixed at the bottom right corner of the page(using CSS fixed postion). this image has a low opacity(0.3),
when the cursor hovers over it, it becomes fully visible and becomes a in page link to take you to the top of the page.

There are 7 other webpages(hp1.html to hp7.html) which all are alike, and since they are 
structuraly same they are linked to the same CSS file sub.css
The first element of these pages are a navigation menu, its made using <nav>,<ul> & <li>. Several styling is done before it 
reaches it's final form. The contents of the navigation menu are Home (home page) & the books other than the book whose page 
we are viewing the momemnt. Below the navigation menu is the main heading(name of the book) in <header>, followed by a <hr>.
There 3 contents in these pages; an introduction to the story of the book, an image & a youtube video(trailer of the film 
adaptation of the book). The styling of these are done in the CSS files so its accessible to all the HTML files. <iframe> tag is
used to place the youtube video in the page, the contents of the tag including the tag itself is available in the share option of 
the youtube video as "embed".
