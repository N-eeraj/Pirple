This is a website project trying to replicate the Apple home page

The 1st section is a navigation bar, its created using <nav>, <ul>, <li> & <a> tags. These are links to different pages of the Apples 
website. The navigation bar is fixed on the screen (using position:fixed). The contents of the navigation bar glow on hovering, this 
is done by setting the opacity to 0.8 initially & 1 on hovering. This is followed by a couple of sections a quick covid test & a 
online shopping sections. All of the link text gets an underline on hovering.

There are 3 full-width links, these links are made using <a> tag and its backround image is set in the CSS file. Each of these 3
has another link placed within the area. All the conents of the page are responsive, the change after the size of 700px in width. 
The background images change their size, the most nobale change is in the 1st link (iPhone SE 2020) which changes the background 
image. This is followed by 6 half-width links, after the screen size hits the 700px width mark the images becomes full sized 
and gets stack up on top of another resulting in the change of a 3x2 layout to a 6x1.

Then there's a footer section with all the terms & condition.
